    "# Train-Test Data Split\n",

    "## Why is it Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a machine learning model, it is crucial to evaluate the trained model on data that was not used to fit it, as generalization is more important than memorization. We want a model that generalizes to new data, rather than simply memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct evaluation is easily done by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leaving out a subset of the data when training the model\n",
    "2. Using the remaining data afterwards for model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used to fit a model is called *training data*, while the data used to assess a model is called *testing data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can load more data that was left out from the original dataset to further evaluate our model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is known as the *train-test data split*, and it's an essential step in building reliable machine learning models."
